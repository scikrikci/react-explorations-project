# Project Overview

This repository is a learning and experimentation space for various React concepts and features. It serves as a playground where I explore and build components, hooks, animations, and UI effects with React. The project is designed to help deepen my understanding of modern front-end development and improve my React skills through hands-on experimentation.

## Technologies Used:

- **React**: The core framework for building the UI components and hooks.
- **Framer Motion**: Used for smooth and interactive animations, enhancing the user experience.
- **GSAP**: For advanced animations and timelines, providing rich motion control.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling and responsive design.

This project serves as a foundation for future projects where these technologies will be implemented to build complex, interactive, and visually appealing applications. The components and hooks developed here will be reused and integrated into other projects as they grow in scope and complexity.
